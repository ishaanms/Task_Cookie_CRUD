# Cookie 
- Javascript Cookies are not the best functinality for codes if used natively. It is a bit painful. Why not solve this problem?
- I have created following functions so that accessing data via cookies becomes easy.:
  1. setCookie(key, value)
  2. getCookie(key)
  3. deleteCookie(key)
  4. listCookies()
